as the following steps, data analysis process can be performed. Before run the codes, metaX packages is required to install in R.

## Brief descriptionc

* Data normalization, transformation, scaling and cleansing are included in metaX.R. Univariant and Multivariant 
analysis are also performed by metaX.R.
* Heatmap of interested features was drawn by heatmap.R.
* Boxplot of interested features was drawn by boxplot.R.
* feature selection using random forest method and ROC analysis were performed by metaXROC.R.
